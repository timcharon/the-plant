    <br>
    one morning, on my way to work, i met a talking plant.
    <br>
    it was laying on the floor, surrounded by stones, unnoticed.
    <br>
    to my surprise, it looked like a stone as well.
    <br>
    i did not expect it to talk, but a talking plant was nothing unimaginable.
    <br>
    however, i had never seen a plant that looked like a stone before.
    <br>
    it felt like a stone,
    <br>
    it was as heavy as a stone,
    <br>
    it even tasted like a stone tastes.
    <br>
    and yet it was a plant.
